### About

This script generates a group of address and appends onto a pre-existing [DMW](https://github.com/aldelaro5/Dolphin-memory-engine) file. This is useful for when you want to test the values at a range of memory addresses. You will need to modify the variables at the top of the file to point to your local DMW files for it to work correctly.
